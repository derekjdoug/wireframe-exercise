### Reflections and Comments

- CSS is still mystical to me. This wireframe is the result of slowing understanding more layout ideas and properties and a lot of trial and error. I'm glad we weren't able to use id or class selectors, as that was a good exercise in keeping it simple and practicing the syntax of CSS.
